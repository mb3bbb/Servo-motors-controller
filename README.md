Detail description: 
The equipment needed in this project: 1.UNO Arduino 2. 6 Servo motors, 6 Potentiometer.
To move each servo motor individually, You need to add each Potentiometer in specific analog bin by using UNO Arduino, Then add each servo motor in digital bin. 
Connect VCC,GND in UNO Arduino to VCC in servo motors As you see in the circuit.
Add the codes. 
Finally Run.
